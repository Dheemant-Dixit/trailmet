Please run following command before pushing the code to make sure all linting test pass.

```
pip install pre-commit==3.3.3
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If the tests fails at first time, please run `pre-commit run --all-files` again to make sure all the changes done in first run passes second time and all tests are passing now.
